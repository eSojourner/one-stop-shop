This program was designed to intake an English .mp3 file and, from that file, provide an English transcript, a Spanish transcript, as well as a narrated Spanish version. This utilizes WhisperAI for transcription, a locally hosted Ollama model for translation, and the gTTS library for narration. The transcription and translation happens locally on the device, but the narration happens through Google Translate.
