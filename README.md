This program was designed to intake an English .mp3 file and, from that file, provide an English transcript, a Spanish transcript, as well as a narrated Spanish version. This utilizes WhisperAI for transcription, DeepL's free API for translation, and the gTTS library for narration. The transcription happens locally on the device, but the translation and the narration happen in the cloud.
